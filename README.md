!What is working here?

Go to the page http://localhost:3000/admin/questions and wait several seconds to see list of questions, gotten from heroku server.

You can also add question using form on this page (question must be unique, otherwise you get 400 response). Deleting/changing doesn't work because of CORS policy (unresolved problem on server, not my duty).
